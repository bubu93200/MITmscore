explain Qprocess in QML

QProcess is a class in the Qt framework that allows you to launch and interact with external processes from within a Qt application. In QML, QProcess can be used to launch an external executable or command line tool and receive output from it.

To use QProcess in QML, you first need to import the QtQuick.Process module:

arduino

import QtQuick.Process 1.0

You can then create an instance of QProcess in your QML code:

css

Process {
    id: myProcess
    executable: "myExecutable"
    arguments: ["arg1", "arg2"]
    onStarted: console.log("Process started")
    onFinished: console.log("Process finished with exit code", exitCode)
    onReadyReadStandardOutput: console.log("Standard output:", readAllStandardOutput())
    onReadyReadStandardError: console.log("Standard error:", readAllStandardError())
}

In this example, we create a QProcess object called myProcess that will execute the executable called myExecutable with the arguments arg1 and arg2. We also connect some signals to receive output from the process, such as onReadyReadStandardOutput and onReadyReadStandardError.

When the process is started using the start() method of the QProcess object, the signals we have connected to will be emitted when there is new output from the process or when the process finishes. We can then use the methods of the QProcess object to retrieve the output, such as readAllStandardOutput() or readAllStandardError(), which will return the entire output from the process as a string.

Overall, QProcess in QML provides a convenient way to launch external processes and receive output from them within a Qt application.

show me code in QML and C++ to connect with Qprocess the external programm written in C++ with arguments in and out

Sure! Here's an example of how you can use QProcess to launch an external C++ program from a QML user interface, passing in command line arguments and capturing its output.

First, let's create the external C++ program. This program takes two integer arguments, adds them together, and returns the result as a string. Here's the code for the program:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 3) {
        std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <num1> <num2>" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int num1, num2;
    std::istringstream(argv[1]) >> num1;
    std::istringstream(argv[2]) >> num2;

    int result = num1 + num2;

    std::cout << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

Save this code as myProgram.cpp and compile it into an executable called myProgram.

Next, let's create a QML user interface that will launch myProgram and capture its output. Here's the QML code:

qml

import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.Controls 2.0
import QtQuick.Layouts 1.0
import QtQuick.Process 1.0

ApplicationWindow {
    visible: true
    width: 400
    height: 200
    title: "QProcess Example"

    ColumnLayout {
        anchors.centerIn: parent
        spacing: 10

        Label {
            text: "Enter two numbers to add:"
        }

        RowLayout {
            spacing: 10

            TextField {
                id: num1Field
                placeholderText: "Number 1"
            }

            TextField {
                id: num2Field
                placeholderText: "Number 2"
            }

            Button {
                text: "Add"
                onClicked: {
                    // Create a QProcess object
                    var process = new QProcess();

                    // Connect signals to receive output from the process
                    process.readyReadStandardOutput.connect(function() {
                        var output = process.readAllStandardOutput();
                        console.log("Output from myProgram: " + output);
                    });

                    // Set up command line arguments
                    var num1 = num1Field.text;
                    var num2 = num2Field.text;
                    var args = [num1, num2];

                    // Launch the external program with arguments
                    process.start("./myProgram", args);

                    // Wait for the process to finish
                    process.waitForFinished(-1);

                    // Get the result from the process output
                    var result = process.readAllStandardOutput();
                    console.log("Result: " + result);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

In this QML code, we create a user interface that prompts the user to enter two numbers to add together. When the user clicks the "Add" button, we create a QProcess object and connect signals to receive output from the process. We then set up the command line arguments for the external program by getting the text from the two number input fields. We launch the external program with the start() method of the QProcess object, passing in the path to the myProgram executable and the arguments. We wait for the process to finish with the waitForFinished() method of the QProcess object. Finally, we get the result from the process output and log it to the console.

To connect the QML code to the C++ code, we need to add a few lines of C++ code to the main.cpp file:

cpp

#include <

bruno.donati@hotmail.fr
finish

That's it! This example shows how you can use QProcess to launch an external C++ program from a QML user interface, passing in command line arguments and capturing its output. By connecting signals to receive output from the process, you can easily interact with external programs from within your Qt application.
bruno.donati@hotmail.fr
finish this code #include <

Sure! Here's an example of how you can use QProcess in C++ to launch an external program and capture its output:

cpp

#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QProcess>
#include <QDebug>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);

    // Create a QProcess object
    QProcess process;

    // Connect signals to receive output from the process
    QObject::connect(&process, &QProcess::readyReadStandardOutput, [&]() {
        QByteArray output = process.readAllStandardOutput();
        qDebug() << "Output from external program:" << output;
    });
    QObject::connect(&process, &QProcess::readyReadStandardError, [&]() {
        QByteArray error = process.readAllStandardError();
        qDebug() << "Error from external program:" << error;
    });

    // Launch the external program
    QString program = "ls"; // replace with the path to your executable
    QStringList arguments = {"-l", "/tmp"}; // replace with the arguments to pass to the executable
    process.start(program, arguments);

    // Wait for the process to finish
    if (!process.waitForFinished()) {
        qDebug() << "Process failed to finish:" << process.errorString();
        return 1;
    }

    // Get the result from the process output
    QByteArray result = process.readAllStandardOutput();
    qDebug() << "Result:" << result;

    return 0;
}

In this C++ code, we create a QProcess object and connect signals to receive output from the process. We then launch an external program with the start() method of the QProcess object, passing in the path to the executable and any arguments. We wait for the process to finish with the waitForFinished() method of the QProcess object. Finally, we get the result from the process output and print it to the console.

Note that you should replace the program variable with the path to your own executable, and replace the arguments variable with the arguments to pass to the executable.

can we write c++ code in QML

It is not possible to write C++ code directly in QML, as QML is a declarative language for designing user interfaces and does not support imperative programming.

However, you can use JavaScript in QML to call C++ code. Qt provides a way to integrate C++ code into QML using the QObject class. By creating a C++ class that inherits from QObject, you can expose its methods and properties to QML and call them from JavaScript.

Here is an example of how to create a C++ class and use it in QML:

cpp

#include <QObject>
#include <QDebug>

class MyObject : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit MyObject(QObject *parent = nullptr) : QObject(parent) {}

public slots:
    void doSomething(QString arg) {
        qDebug() << "C++ code received argument from QML:" << arg;
    }
};

In this example, we create a MyObject class that inherits from QObject. We define a single slot called doSomething that takes a QString argument and prints it to the console using qDebug().

To use this class in QML, we need to register it with the QML engine using qmlRegisterType():

cpp

#include <QGuiApplication>
#include <QQmlApplicationEngine>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);

    // Register the MyObject class with the QML engine
    qmlRegisterType<MyObject>("com.example", 1, 0, "MyObject");

    QQmlApplicationEngine engine;
    engine.load(QUrl(QStringLiteral("qrc:/main.qml")));
    if (engine.rootObjects().isEmpty())
        return -1;

    return app.exec();
}

In this example, we register the MyObject class with the QML engine using qmlRegisterType(). We pass in the class name, the version number, and the name we want to use in QML to refer to the class. In this case, we're using the name "MyObject".

Now we can use the MyObject class in QML:

qml

import QtQuick 2.15
import com.example 1.0

Rectangle {
    width: 640
    height: 480

    MyObject {
        id: myObject
    }

    Button {
        text: "Call C++ code"
        onClicked: {
            myObject.doSomething("Hello from QML!");
        }
    }
}

In this QML code, we import the com.example module and create an instance of the MyObject class. We also create a Button that calls the doSomething() slot on the MyObject instance when it is clicked.

When we run the application, clicking the button in the QML user interface will call the doSomething() slot in the C++ code and print the argument to the console.

how to use a c++ code in QML as an exception. We want to do other things in QML program when C++ program is running

To use a C++ code in QML as an exception, you can use the QtConcurrent module of Qt, which provides a way to run C++ code in a separate thread from the main thread of the QML application. This allows you to keep the QML user interface responsive while the C++ code is running in the background.

Here's an example of how to use QtConcurrent to run a C++ function in the background:

cpp

#include <QObject>
#include <QFuture>
#include <QtConcurrent>

class MyObject : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit MyObject(QObject *parent = nullptr) : QObject(parent) {}

signals:
    void resultReady(QString result);

public slots:
    void runInBackground(QString arg) {
        // Run the C++ code in a separate thread
        QFuture<void> future = QtConcurrent::run(this, &MyObject::runCPlusPlusCode, arg);
        future.waitForFinished();

        // Emit a signal with the result
        emit resultReady("C++ code finished running");
    }

private:
    void runCPlusPlusCode(QString arg) {
        // Do some long-running C++ operation
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
            // Do nothing
        }
    }
};

In this example, we define a MyObject class with a runInBackground() slot that takes a QString argument. Inside the runInBackground() slot, we use QtConcurrent::run() to run the runCPlusPlusCode() function in a separate thread. This function does some long-running operation, such as a computation, file I/O, or networking.

When the operation is finished, the resultReady() signal is emitted with a string message that indicates that the operation has completed.

To use this class in QML, we can create an instance of the MyObject class and connect to its resultReady() signal:

qml

import QtQuick 2.15
import QtQuick.Controls 2.15

Rectangle {
    width: 640
    height: 480

    MyObject {
        id: myObject
        onResultReady: {
            // Do something in QML when the C++ operation is finished
            console.log(result)
        }
    }

    Button {
        text: "Run C++ code in background"
        onClicked: {
            myObject.runInBackground("Hello from QML!")
        }
    }
}

In this QML code, we create an instance of the MyObject class and connect to its resultReady() signal using the onResultReady property. When the signal is emitted, we print the result to the console using console.log().

We also create a Button that calls the runInBackground() slot on the MyObject instance when it is clicked.

When we run the application, clicking the button in the QML user interface will run the runInBackground() slot in the C++ code in a separate thread. The resultReady() signal is emitted when the operation is finished, and the QML user interface remains responsive during this time.
bruno.donati@hotmail.fr
with Qprocess ?

Yes, you can use QProcess to run a C++ program in the background and communicate with it from QML. Here's an example of how to do it:

First, create a C++ program that takes input from stdin, does some computation, and outputs the result to stdout. Here's an example:

cpp

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int input;
    std::cin >> input;
    int result = input * 2;
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

Next, create a QML user interface that takes input from the user and runs the C++ program in the background using QProcess. Here's an example:

qml

import QtQuick 2.15
import QtQuick.Controls 2.15

Rectangle {
    width: 640
    height: 480

    TextInput {
        id: inputField
        placeholderText: "Enter a number"
        validator: IntValidator {
            bottom: 1
        }
    }

    Button {
        text: "Run C++ program"
        onClicked: {
            // Create a QProcess to run the C++ program
            var process = Qt.createQmlObject('import QtQuick 2.0; Qt.createQmlObject("import QtQuick.Processes 1.0; Process { }", parent)');
            process.setProgram("path/to/your/cpp/program");
            process.setArguments([inputField.text]);
            process.start();

            // Connect to the QProcess signals
            process.readyReadStandardOutput.connect(function() {
                // Read the output from the C++ program and update the UI
                var output = process.readAllStandardOutput();
                resultLabel.text = "Result: " + output;
            });
            process.finished.connect(function(exitCode, exitStatus) {
                // Clean up the QProcess object
                process.deleteLater();
            });
        }
    }

    Label {
        id: resultLabel
        text: ""
    }
}

In this QML code, we create a TextInput field that allows the user to enter a number. We also create a Button that runs the C++ program in the background when clicked.

When the button is clicked, we create a QProcess object and set its program and arguments using process.setProgram() and process.setArguments(). We then start the process using process.start().

Next, we connect to the readyReadStandardOutput signal of the QProcess object using process.readyReadStandardOutput.connect(). This signal is emitted when the C++ program outputs data to stdout. We read the output using process.readAllStandardOutput() and update the UI using resultLabel.text = "Result: " + output;.

Finally, we connect to the finished signal of the QProcess object using process.finished.connect(). This signal is emitted when the C++ program finishes running. We clean up the QProcess object using process.deleteLater().

explain this on a program to add 2 numbers but diplay is written in c++ program as executable

Sure, here's an example of how to add two numbers in a C++ program and display the result using the executable:

    Create a C++ program that adds two numbers and displays the result:

cpp

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;
    std::cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    std::cin >> num1 >> num2;
    sum = num1 + num2;
    std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

This program asks the user to enter two numbers, adds them together, and displays the result on the console.

    Compile the C++ program to create an executable file:

g++ add_numbers.cpp -o add_numbers

This creates an executable file called add_numbers.

    Create a QML user interface that takes two numbers as input and displays the result using the add_numbers executable:

qml

import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.Controls 2.15

Rectangle {
    width: 300
    height: 200

    Column {
        spacing: 10

        TextField {
            id: num1Field
            placeholderText: "Enter a number"
        }

        TextField {
            id: num2Field
            placeholderText: "Enter another number"
        }

        Button {
            text: "Add Numbers"
            onClicked: {
                // Create a QProcess to run the add_numbers executable
                var process = Qt.createQmlObject('import QtQuick 2.0; Qt.createQmlObject("import QtQuick.Processes 1.0; Process { }", parent)');
                process.setProgram("add_numbers");
                process.setArguments([num1Field.text, num2Field.text]);
                process.start();

                // Connect to the QProcess signals
                process.readyReadStandardOutput.connect(function() {
                    // Read the output from the add_numbers executable and update the UI
                    var output = process.readAllStandardOutput();
                    resultLabel.text = output;
                });
                process.finished.connect(function(exitCode, exitStatus) {
                    // Clean up the QProcess object
                    process.deleteLater();
                });
            }
        }

        Label {
            id: resultLabel
            text: ""
        }
    }
}

In this QML code, we create a user interface that has two TextFields for the user to enter two numbers and a Button to add the numbers. When the user clicks the Button, we create a QProcess object to run the add_numbers executable, passing the two numbers as arguments using process.setArguments([num1Field.text, num2Field.text]).

We connect to the readyReadStandardOutput signal of the QProcess object using process.readyReadStandardOutput.connect(). This signal is emitted when the add_numbers executable outputs data to stdout. We read the output using process.readAllStandardOutput() and update the UI using resultLabel.text = output;.

Finally, we connect to the finished signal of the QProcess object using process.finished.connect(). This signal is emitted when the add_numbers executable finishes running. We clean up the QProcess object using process.deleteLater().

diffrenecies between Qt.createQmlObject and Qprocess

Qt.createQmlObject and QProcess are both part of the Qt framework, but they serve different purposes.

Qt.createQmlObject is a method in QML that allows you to create QML objects dynamically at runtime. It takes a string representing a QML definition and returns an instance of the object created from that definition. This method is useful for creating QML objects on the fly, such as creating a new instance of a custom component based on user input.

QProcess, on the other hand, is a class in Qt that allows you to start and control external processes from within your application. It provides a way to run command-line programs and interact with them by sending input and reading output. QProcess can be used to start an external program, set its command-line arguments, and read the output of the program as it runs. This is useful for running complex tasks that require specialized tools or libraries that are not built into your application.

In summary, Qt.createQmlObject is used to dynamically create QML objects at runtime, while QProcess is used to start and control external processes from within your application.
bruno.donati@hotmail.fr
but why create QML objets if we have an executable. Why do not use Qprocess?

You're right that if you have an executable that performs a certain task, it's generally better to use QProcess to run that executable from within your Qt application, rather than creating a new QML object to perform the same task.

Qt.createQmlObject is useful for dynamically creating QML objects, but it's not the best choice for running external programs. QProcess provides more control and flexibility for running external programs, such as setting environment variables, redirecting standard input and output, and handling process events.

Additionally, running an external program using QProcess allows you to keep your application code separate from the code of the external program. This can make your application more modular and easier to maintain. If you need to make changes to the external program, you can do so independently of your Qt application, without affecting the rest of your application code.

So, in short, if you have an external program that performs a certain task, it's generally better to use QProcess to run that program from within your Qt application, rather than creating a new QML object to perform the same task.

so explain how to use QT.createqmlobject ? for with purpose

Qt.createQmlObject is a method in QML that allows you to create QML objects dynamically at runtime. This can be useful in a number of situations, such as:

    Creating custom user interface components: You can create custom QML components based on user input, such as a dynamically generated form or table.

    Managing dynamic data: You can create QML objects to manage dynamic data, such as a list of items that is generated at runtime.

    Creating animations and effects: You can create QML objects to manage animations and effects that are generated at runtime, such as a particle effect or a dynamic transition between two states.

The Qt.createQmlObject method takes two parameters: a string representing a QML definition, and an optional parent object for the new object. The QML definition can include properties, signals, and slots, and can also reference other QML components or C++ classes.

Here's an example of using Qt.createQmlObject to dynamically create a rectangle in QML:

css

import QtQuick 2.0

Rectangle {
    id: dynamicRectangle
    width: 100
    height: 100
    color: "red"
}

Component.onCompleted: {
    var newRectangle = Qt.createQmlObject('import QtQuick 2.0; Rectangle { width: 50; height: 50; color: "blue" }', dynamicRectangle);
    newRectangle.x = 50;
    newRectangle.y = 50;
}

In this example, a Rectangle object is defined with an id of dynamicRectangle. When the Component.onCompleted signal is emitted, the Qt.createQmlObject method is called to create a new Rectangle object with a width of 50, a height of 50, and a color of blue. The new object is then set as a child of the dynamicRectangle object, and its position is set to (50, 50).

Note that Qt.createQmlObject should be used judiciously, as creating too many QML objects at runtime can impact performance. However, in situations where dynamic object creation is necessary, Qt.createQmlObject provides a powerful tool for creating custom user interfaces and managing dynamic data in QML.

is it possible to launch an run an executable in background with Qprocess

Yes, it's possible to launch and run an executable in the background with QProcess.

To run an executable in the background, you can use the startDetached method of QProcess. This method starts the process and immediately returns control to the calling application, allowing the process to continue running in the background.

Here's an example of using QProcess::startDetached to run an executable in the background:

arduino

#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QProcess>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QCoreApplication a(argc, argv);

    QString program = "/path/to/your/executable";
    QStringList arguments;
    arguments << "arg1" << "arg2" << "arg3";

    QProcess::startDetached(program, arguments);

    return a.exec();
}

In this example, QProcess::startDetached is called with the path to the executable and a list of arguments. The executable is started in the background and control is immediately returned to the calling application.

Note that startDetached does not provide any way to communicate with the process once it has been started. If you need to communicate with the process, you should use the start method instead, and set up communication using QProcess signals and slots.

Also, keep in mind that launching an executable in the background can have security implications, as the user may not be aware that the process is running. Make sure that you have a legitimate reason for running the process in the background, and that you take appropriate security precautions.
bruno.donati@hotmail.fr
ok but use startdetached in QML

QProcess::startDetached can also be used in QML, but it requires some additional steps to make it work.

To use QProcess::startDetached in QML, you need to create an instance of QProcess in C++ code and expose it to QML using qmlRegisterType. Then, you can call the startDetached method from QML using the exposed instance of QProcess.

Here's an example of how to use QProcess::startDetached in QML:

    Create a C++ class that subclasses QObject and contains an instance of QProcess:

arduino

// myprocess.h
#include <QObject>
#include <QProcess>

class MyProcess : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    explicit MyProcess(QObject *parent = nullptr);

public slots:
    void startDetached(const QString &program, const QStringList &arguments);

private:
    QProcess *m_process;
};

javascript

// myprocess.cpp
#include "myprocess.h"

MyProcess::MyProcess(QObject *parent) :
    QObject(parent),
    m_process(new QProcess(this))
{
}

void MyProcess::startDetached(const QString &program, const QStringList &arguments)
{
    m_process->startDetached(program, arguments);
}

    Register the MyProcess class with QML using qmlRegisterType:

arduino

// main.cpp
#include <QGuiApplication>
#include <QQmlApplicationEngine>
#include "myprocess.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QCoreApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_EnableHighDpiScaling);

    QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);

    qmlRegisterType<MyProcess>("com.example", 1, 0, "MyProcess");

    QQmlApplicationEngine engine;
    engine.load(QUrl(QStringLiteral("qrc:/main.qml")));
    if (engine.rootObjects().isEmpty())
        return -1;

    return app.exec();
}

    In QML, create an instance of MyProcess and call its startDetached method:

css

import QtQuick 2.0
import com.example 1.0

MyProcess {
    id: myProcess
}

Button {
    text: "Start Process"
    onClicked: {
        myProcess.startDetached("/path/to/your/executable", ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"])
    }
}

In this example, a MyProcess instance is created in QML, and its startDetached method is called when a button is clicked. The path to the executable and its arguments are passed as parameters to startDetached.

Note that in order for QProcess::startDetached to work properly, the executable must be located in a directory that is in the system's search path. If the executable is not in the search path, you will need to specify the full path to the executable.

no. use startdetached in QML to launch an run an external program in background.

Yes, you can use QProcess::startDetached in QML to launch an external program in the background. Here's an example:

arduino

import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.Controls 2.12

Button {
    text: "Start Program"
    onClicked: {
        Qt.startDetached("/path/to/your/executable", ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"])
    }
}

In this example, a button is created in QML, and its onClicked signal is connected to a JavaScript function that calls Qt.startDetached with the path to the executable and its arguments. This will launch the executable in the background.

Note that QProcess::startDetached is a static function of the Qt object, so you can call it directly from QML without needing to create an instance of QProcess. Also note that startDetached returns immediately, so it does not block the QML thread.

ok. but complete program. How to stop process for example? how to pass arguments from external program to QML

Sure! Here's a complete QML program that demonstrates how to use startDetached to launch an external program in the background, how to stop the process, and how to pass data from the external program back to the QML program:

arduino

import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.Controls 2.12

Button {
    id: startButton
    text: "Start Program"
    onClicked: {
        // Start the external program with arguments
        var process = Qt.startDetached("/path/to/your/executable", ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"])
        
        // Store the process ID for later use
        startButton.processId = process
        
        // Disable the start button and enable the stop button
        startButton.enabled = false
        stopButton.enabled = true
    }
}

Button {
    id: stopButton
    text: "Stop Program"
    enabled: false
    onClicked: {
        // Stop the external program
        var processId = startButton.processId
        if (processId) {
            Qt.Process.kill(processId)
            startButton.processId = null
        }
        
        // Enable the start button and disable the stop button
        startButton.enabled = true
        stopButton.enabled = false
    }
}

Text {
    id: resultText
    text: "Result: " + result
}

Connections {
    target: process // connect to the process object
    
    // Called when the process writes to its standard output
    onReadyReadStandardOutput: {
        // Read the output data
        var data = process.readAllStandardOutput().toString().trim()
        
        // Update the result text with the output data
        result = data
    }
}

property string result: "" // store the result data

This program consists of two buttons (startButton and stopButton) and a text label (resultText). When the user clicks the startButton, the external program is launched in the background using Qt.startDetached. The processId of the running process is stored in the startButton so it can be stopped later. The startButton is disabled and the stopButton is enabled to prevent the user from starting multiple instances of the external program.

When the user clicks the stopButton, the external program is stopped using Qt.Process.kill. The processId is cleared and the startButton is re-enabled.

The Connections object connects to the process object (which is automatically created by startDetached) and listens for the readyReadStandardOutput signal. When this signal is emitted, the onReadyReadStandardOutput handler is called. This handler reads the data from the standard output of the external program, updates the result property with the output data, and displays it in the resultText label.

Note that you can also read data from the standard error output of the external program using the readyReadStandardError signal and the readAllStandardError method.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

ok. Show to complete example with QML program and external program written in C++.

Sure, here's a complete example that demonstrates how to use startDetached to launch an external C++ program in the background and how to pass data from the external program back to the QML program:

C++ Program (example.cpp):

c

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Get the command line arguments
    if (argc < 3) {
        cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <number1> <number2>" << endl;
        return 1;
    }
    int num1 = atoi(argv[1]);
    int num2 = atoi(argv[2]);
    
    // Add the numbers and print the result
    int result = num1 + num2;
    cout << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}

QML Program (main.qml):

arduino

import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.Controls 2.12

Button {
    id: startButton
    text: "Start Program"
    onClicked: {
        // Start the external program with arguments
        var process = Qt.startDetached("./example", [num1Field.text, num2Field.text])
        
        // Store the process ID for later use
        startButton.processId = process
        
        // Disable the start button and enable the stop button
        startButton.enabled = false
        stopButton.enabled = true
    }
}

Button {
    id: stopButton
    text: "Stop Program"
    enabled: false
    onClicked: {
        // Stop the external program
        var processId = startButton.processId
        if (processId) {
            Qt.Process.kill(processId)
            startButton.processId = null
        }
        
        // Enable the start button and disable the stop button
        startButton.enabled = true
        stopButton.enabled = false
    }
}

TextField {
    id: num1Field
    placeholderText: "Number 1"
    validator: IntValidator { bottom: 0; top: 999 }
}

TextField {
    id: num2Field
    placeholderText: "Number 2"
    validator: IntValidator { bottom: 0; top: 999 }
}

Text {
    id: resultText
    text: "Result: " + result
}

Connections {
    target: process // connect to the process object
    
    // Called when the process writes to its standard output
    onReadyReadStandardOutput: {
        // Read the output data
        var data = process.readAllStandardOutput().toString().trim()
        
        // Update the result text with the output data
        result = data
    }
}

property string result: "" // store the result data

In this example, the QML program has two text fields (num1Field and num2Field) for entering the two numbers to be added, a startButton to launch the external C++ program, a stopButton to stop the program, and a resultText label to display the result.

When the user clicks the startButton, the external C++ program (example) is launched in the background using Qt.startDetached. The command line arguments passed to the program are the values entered in the num1Field and num2Field text fields. The processId of the running process is stored in the startButton so it can be stopped later. The startButton is disabled and the stopButton is enabled to prevent the user from starting multiple instances of the external program.

When the user clicks the stopButton, the external program is stopped using `

thanks but use another example with extern program running for a long time. For example, a program hearing key hitten and stocking all and QML program displaying chars  stocked between before display to now

Here is an example of a program that runs an external program written in C++ which listens for keyboard events and sends the captured input to the QML program:

External program (written in C++):

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <conio.h>

int main()
{
    std::string input;

    while (true) {
        char ch = _getch();
        if (ch == '\r') {
            std::cout << "You typed: " << input << std::endl;
            input.clear();
        } else {
            input += ch;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

QML program:

qml

import QtQuick 2.15
import QtQuick.Window 2.15

Window {
    visible: true
    width: 640
    height: 480
    title: "Key Logger"

    Text {
        id: logText
        text: ""
        font.pixelSize: 20
        anchors.centerIn: parent
    }

    Component.onCompleted: {
        // Start the external program in the background
        var process = Qt.createQmlObject("import QtQuick 2.15; import QtQuick.Controls 2.15; Process { program: 'keylogger.exe'; startDetached: true }", parent);

        // Listen for output from the external program
        process.readyReadStandardOutput.connect(function() {
            var input = process.readAllStandardOutput().toString();
            input = input.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm, "");
            logText.text += input;
        });

        // Stop the external program when the QML program is closed
        ClosingEvent.connect(function() {
            process.kill();
        });
    }
}

When the QML program is run, it starts the external program in the background using the startDetached option of Qt.createQmlObject(). It then listens for output from the external program and appends it to the Text element in the QML program.

When the QML program is closed, it stops the external program by calling process.kill().

no. dont forget discussion. all characters are stocked by c++ program in background and with a timer QML program display all characters

My apologies for misunderstanding your initial request. Here's an updated example that should fulfill your requirements:

External program (written in C++):

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <conio.h>

int main()
{
    std::string input;

    while (true) {
        char ch = _getch();
        if (ch == '\r') {
            std::cout << input << std::endl;
            input.clear();
        } else {
            input += ch;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

QML program:

qml

import QtQuick 2.15
import QtQuick.Window 2.15

Window {
    visible: true
    width: 640
    height: 480
    title: "Key Logger"

    Text {
        id: logText
        text: ""
        font.pixelSize: 20
        anchors.centerIn: parent
    }

    Timer {
        id: timer
        interval: 1000
        running: true
        onTriggered: {
            // Read all available characters from the external program
            var input = process.readAllStandardOutput().toString();
            input = input.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm, "");

            // Append the characters to the text element
            logText.text += input;
        }
    }

    Component.onCompleted: {
        // Start the external program in the background
        var process = Qt.createQmlObject("import QtQuick 2.15; import QtQuick.Controls 2.15; Process { program: 'keylogger.exe'; startDetached: true }", parent);

        // Save the process object so we can access it later
        timer.process = process;

        // Stop the external program when the QML program is closed
        ClosingEvent.connect(function() {
            process.kill();
        });
    }
}

This program works in a similar way to the previous example, except that instead of immediately displaying characters as they're received, it buffers them and displays them in one-second intervals using a Timer element.

The C++ program is the same as before, but we're now only printing the characters that are received (without the "You typed:" prefix).

In the QML program, we've added a Timer element that triggers every second and reads all available characters from the external program's output. The characters are then appended to the Text element.

Note that we're now saving the process object as a property of the Timer element so we can access it later. This is necessary because we need to read from the process's output continuously, and we can't do that within the Component.onCompleted block (since that only runs once).
